`Two lovers sat on a park bench with their bodies touching each other, holding hands in the moonlight
There was silence between them
So profound was their love for each other,
they needed no words to express it.
And so they sat in silence, on a park bench, with their bodies touching,
holding hands in the moonlight

Finally she spoke
"Do you love me, John?" she asked
"You know I love you, darling," he replied.
"I love you more than tongue can tell
You are the light of my life
my sun, moon and stars.
You are my everything.
Without you I have no reason for being"
Again there was silence as the two lovers sat on a park bench,
their bodies touching, holding hands in the moonlight.
Once more she spoke.
"How much do you love me, John?" she asked
He answered, "How much do I love you? Count the stars in the sky
Measure the waters of the oceans with a teaspoon
Number the grains of sand on the seashore
Impossible, you say.
Yes and it is just as impossible for me to say how much I love you
My love for you is higher than the heavens,
deeper than Hades, and broader than the Earth.
It has no limits, no bounds
Everything must have an ending except my love for you."

There was more of silence as the two lovers sat on a park bench
with their bodies touching, holding hands in the moonlight

Once more her voice was heard
"Kiss me, John" she implored
And leaning over, he pressed his lips warmly to hers in fervent osculation

I grinned. She had a huge smile on her face. Wow, what a smile. She was so beautiful. What a perfect person. She makes me love everybody. I’ll never know anyone like her again because I’ll never know anyone like anyone again. I’ll love her forever and I’ll never see her again. In that moment, I understood the entire experience of loving her forever. She and I understood forever. I’m so sad about the persons I’ve failed to love forever, and I always will be. I’m happy I loved her forever; it is a great joy to know I spent two short days inside someone else’s full understanding of me.
